## Introduction

Cpnucleo is a sample solution that demonstrates how to implement industry best practices when developing .NET projects. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning tool and a reference implementation that covers everything from clean architecture principles and dependency injection to unit testing and containerization.

---

## Project Overview

This repository is designed for:
- **Beginners** aiming to learn best practices in modern .NET projects.
- **Experienced developers** looking for a reliable reference implementation.
- **Teams** seeking to set a standard for coding conventions, project structure, and CI/CD pipeline integration.

**Highlights:**
- Clean and modular project structure
- Robust error handling and logging
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Docker integration for containerized deployments
- Extensive documentation for ease of onboarding

---

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns using layered architecture, domain-driven design, and SOLID principles.
- **Extensible Design:** Easily extend and customize the solution to fit your specific requirements.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Integrated logging and detailed exception management.
- **Test Coverage:** Extensive unit and integration tests ensuring high reliability.
- **Containerized Environment:** Dockerfile provided for building and running the app in a containerized environment.
- **CI/CD Ready:** Sample configurations and scripts for automated build, test, and deployment processes.

---

## Architecture

The solution follows an organized structure that promotes:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear distribution between UI, Business Logic, and Data Access layers.
- **Dependency Injection:** Decoupled components for easy testing and maintainability.
- **Configuration Management:** Centralized configuration that adapts to different environments.

A high-level diagram of the architecture is provided below:

## Technologies Used

- **C# & .NET:** Primary language and framework.
- **Docker:** Containerization via provided Dockerfile.
- **Entity Framework Core:** ORM for database interactions.
- **xUnit:** For unit testing.
- **AutoMapper:** Object-to-object mapping.
- **Logging Framework:** Integrated logging (e.g., Serilog, NLog) for monitoring and troubleshooting.
